    <h2>TUW: Technische Universität Wien (AT)</h2>
    <div class="organisation"><span class="organisation">Organisation</span> Technische Universität Wien, the largest technical university of Austria, is represented by the Automation and Control Institute (ACIN), which employs around 60 persons, most of them researchers graduated in the fields of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science. TUW strongly emphasises the close co-operation with industry and 86% of the scientific employees are funded by national, European, and American research or industry projects. TUW conducts research in the areas of automation technology, control theory, machine vision, and robotics. Specific emphasis of research work is on complex dynamic systems, non-linear control, agile manufacturing, ontologies for automation, and vision for robotics and cognitive systems.</div>
    <div class="main-tasks"><span class="main-tasks">Main tasks</span>Main tasks TUW will be coordinating Squirrel and thus lead WP10. TUW will also be leading work package WP6, concerned with scene segmentation, object categorisation, recognition and tracking as well as attentional mechanisms. Furthermore TUW will contribute to 3D head tracking in WP2. TUW’s tasks also touch mapping in WP4, as segmented and recognised objects are treated as dynamic obstacles rather than static background.</div>
        <div class="experience"><span class="experience">Experience</span> TUW has gathered expertise in vision techniques for robotic applications as participant in a number of national and international research projects, in particular related to machine vision (Rob Vision, FlexPaint), robotics (MOVEMENT, robots@home, GRASP) and cognitive systems (ActIPret, XPERO, CogX) and is currently involved in projects TACO, HOBBIT, STRANDS, DACH project vision@home and Austrian National Science Foundation (FWF) project InSitu.
            <p>TUW’s repertoire of techniques entails techniques for object segmentation (task T6.4) learning and recognising object categories (tasks T6.3, T6.6), learning object models for detection (task T6.5), and tracking (tasks T6.7) as well as task specific attentional mechanisms (tasks T6.2, T6.1). These methods are based on a mixture of colour images, as well as depth images from stereo, time-of-flight (TOF) cameras, tilting laser rangers and RGBD sensors. TUW lays strong emphasis on incorporation of task knowledge, real-time capability and the possibility of online learning. Furthermore TUW has a strong track record in integrating its methods as part of larger cognitive robotics architectures, which is crucial for successful application. Methods developed in the course of the above projects have been applied to grasping known and novel objects; object search; learning object properties such as colour, shape and physical behaviour; human activity recognition; and indoor navigation.</p></div>

<h2>UIBK: Universität Innsbruck (AT)</h2>
<div class="organisation"><span class="organisation">Organisation</span>
    Founded in 1669, the University of Innsbruck today is a global Top-200 university and the second-largest university in Austria. About 28.000 students are currently enrolled in 15 faculties covering most scientific disciplines. The Institute of Computer Science is part of the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Physics (MIP). UIBK Computer Science was founded in 2001 and currently counts 7 professors. It constitutes a highly productive research environment with a very strong proportion of researchers and doctoral students to undergraduate students, currently generates about 5 Million Euros in external funding per year, and has already produced about 10 start-up companies.</div>
<div class="main-tasks"><span class="main-tasks">Main tasks</span>
    UIBK will lead the technical work package WP7 responsible for picking up and placing objects. Moreover, UIBK will closely interact with WP6 in incremental refinement of object categories, with WP2 in the reception and processing of user feedback, and with WP5 in the context of hardware and algorithms for haptic sensing and manipulation.
</div>
<div class="Experience"><span class="experience">Experience</span>
    UIBK has experience in 2D and 3D object modelling and the learning of grasp affordances, with a focus on incrementally-learnable, probabilistic object models that can incorporate diverse types of scene observations and are robust to high levels of clutter and partial occlusions and to some degree of deformation. Most current work is motivated by interactive robotics applications with the aim of equipping robots with the ability to learn about objects and their properties by explorative interaction under various levels of heuristic or human guidance, which are directly brought to bear in Squirrel.  Object modelling and grasping methods developed by Prof. Piater’s team have been successfully deployed on diverse, high-profile robotic platforms, including the ARMAR-III humanoid robot at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, and a platform for highly autonomous exploratory learning at the University of Southern Denmark.
